# Edit Migrations Directly

I don't add any extra migrations and modify existed migrations because I don't want to have a long list of migrations
running each time I do a fully manual test. On the other hand, I'm the only developer of this project for now.
Because of that, there should not any conflicts between my migrations and other developer.
