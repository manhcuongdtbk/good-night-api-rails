# Introduction

In this explaination part, I write about all of my decisions, with external useful resources for further researching.
After reading each article, you will understand why I do this but not that, why I choose this solution over the others,
how I implement what I found on this assignment and hopefully some interesting informations that can help you in your
career.

In case you have any disagreement or want to discuss about something and improve the assignment, feel free to contact me
directly. I'm looking forward to seeing good cooperation between all of us!

Have a great time reading my explainations!

## In Progress Notice

The explaination part is still in progress, it does not fully have all the explainations for this assignment at the time
of writing these lines. There are, maybe, some of my English language mistakes or misunderstanding about the problem.
Don't worry, those will be fulfill when I have enough time.

## How Should You Read

The explaination part is organized on the left side of the screen so that you can follow along my developing process,
see which problem I encountered and how I solve them using which solution from which resource and where I found all
those things.

You can also read it your way, pick which article you like and discover it yourself. I wrote those articles in a manner
that each article is still following the organization but not depends on any other article.
