## In Progress Notice

All parts are still in progress, it does not fully have all the explainations and documentations for this assignment
at the time of writing these lines. There are, maybe, some of my English language mistakes or misunderstanding about
the problem. Don't worry, those will be fulfill when I have enough time.

## Copyright

I write all articles by myself and have external links to the resource that I quote in any article. Feel free to read
and no need to worry about copyright issues!
